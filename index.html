            <h2>Reason For Joining AltSchool Africa</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Joining AltSchool Africa wasn't an easy decision, in fact joining tech has been a decision i have been pondering on for a long time, i think the major attraction to tech for me is the power to create functional things that make life easier for people. i initially dabbled in graphic design and with the knowledge acquired in that field, it was only natural to go deeper by joining the UI/UX train, i kept studying this, practicing and also offering my services for next to nothing so i can get even better at the craft and also gain exposure. i kept at it for a while, more like as a side hustle but even as a side hustle, i didn't feel fulfilled in that industry, slowly, the lack of passion became overwhelming and so, my weekly hours studying and practicing dropped, not to sound cliche but my mind yearned for more, and so one day, a couple of months back, i stumbled on a tweet from hack sultan (i wasn't following him at the time), the tweet was basically a free service provided by AltSchool Africa, which basically is a bunch of explanatory videos of the various schools they teach, the departments under them and what each class entails. I took my tim to watch all of if and what stood out for me was the school of engineering, i was so fascinated with front end, it became my first love, i did my own research using other sources to confirm this passion and it checked out. My research led me to Freecodecamp a free service to learn frontend online and so i begun, till i saw Ruby partner with alt school to discount fees, i took that chance, passed the entrance examinations and here we are. The major thing that made me choose altschool i'd say is the community and the how good students that pass out from there are. So it was an easy decision joining AltSchool Africa and i've loved it ever since.

        </p>
        <p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
        <p>
            My goal for the School Of Engineering Program is to become of the best graduating students in my set by working extra hard to practice the skills and knowledge being taught and after the completion of this course, further my studies by going into backend engineering and also dev ops, becoming a skilled full stack developer. My goal also is to land a well paying that that will be of great help in making all these possible.
